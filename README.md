# Drupal 8 project starter kit

This project provides a starter kit for Drupal 8 projects mixing [Drupal project template for Platform.sh](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupal8) and
 [Docker-based Drupal stack](https://github.com/wodby/docker4drupal) for local development environment. 

## Using as a reference

You can use this repository as a reference for your own Drupal projects, and borrow whatever you need. 

If you are using Platform.sh, I invite you to read further informations on [Drupal project template for Platform.sh](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupal8) page. 

## Managing a Drupal site built with Composer

Nothing is easier than managing a Composer-based Drupal site on Platform.sh. 
See [Drupal 8 and Composer](https://docs.platform.sh/frameworks/drupal8.html) for details. 
For example adding a single module to your Drupal installation is as simple as:

```sh
composer require drupal/devel
git commit -am 'Add the Devel module'
git push
```

## How does this starter kit differ from vanilla Drupal in Drupal.org?

1. There are some differences documented on [Drupal project template for Platform.sh](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupal8#how-does-this-starter-kit-differ-from-vanilla-drupal-from-drupalorg).
2. We include [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/robertoperuzzo/drupal8-starter/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file
to run useful docker containers for local development environment as described here [Docker-based Drupal stack](https://github.com/wodby/docker4drupal).
You are free to tweak it as needed for your particular environment.
sSee also [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Starting your local environment

To start your new project, you need to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and follow the steps below:

### Clone the project
Clone this repository wherever you want
```
$ git clone git@github.com:robertoperuzzo/drupal8-starter.git your-project-nam
$ cd your-project-name
```
                                                               
### Setup docker4drupal
Copy the environment config file
```
$ cp .env.dist .env
```
Then edit this file to set your project name 
```
PROJECT_NAME=my_drupal8_project
```
and choose your application stack. For instance, if you need PHP 7.1 for macOS, you will uncomment only the row.
`PHP_TAG=7.1-dev-macos-4.14.2`
 
```
# Linux (uid 1000 gid 1000)

#PHP_TAG=7.3-dev-4.14.2
#PHP_TAG=7.2-dev-4.14.2
#PHP_TAG=7.1-dev-4.14.2
#PHP_TAG=5.6-dev-4.14.2

# macOS (uid 501 gid 20)

#PHP_TAG=7.3-dev-macos-4.14.2
#PHP_TAG=7.2-dev-macos-4.14.2
PHP_TAG=7.1-dev-macos-4.14.2
#PHP_TAG=5.6-dev-macos-4.14.2
```

finally
```
$ cp docker-compose.override.yml.dist docker-compose.override.yml
```

or, if you are using MacOS
```
$ cp docker-compose.override.yml.macos.dist docker-compose.override.yml
```

### With Platform.sh
Run 
```
$ platform build
```
For more details [Platform.sh CLI](https://docs.platform.sh/gettingstarted/cli.html).  

Copy `settings.local.php` file:
```
$ cp settings.local.php .platform/local/shared/settings.local.php
```

Run this command from your shell to build up your docker containers. 
```
$ make up
```

Open [http://drupal.docker.localhost:8000/](http://drupal.docker.localhost:8000/) in your browser and enjoy 
your brand new Drupal 8 website!

## Without Platform.sh
Run 
```
composer install
```
If you don't have *composer* installed, follow this [tutorial](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

Run this command from your shell to build up your docker containers. 
```
$ make up
```

Open [http://drupal.docker.localhost:8000/](http://drupal.docker.localhost:8000/) in your browser and enjoy 
your brand new Drupal 8 website!

## Updating Remotes
You'll need to update your git remotes to reflect that you won't be pushing to github.com with your projectâ€™s code. 
You should rename the original origin remote (the github.com [Drupal 8 project template](https://github.com/robertoperuzzo/drupal8-starter) repository) 
to 'starter' and create a new origin pointed at your bare repository.

(On your local development environment)

```
git remote rename origin starter
git remote add origin path/to/your/central/git/repo
```

To see a list of your remote repositories, run the command:

```
git remote
```

For a more detailed listing that includes the remote repositories' URLs, add a -v flag (for verbose) to the end of the command:

```
git remote -v
```
